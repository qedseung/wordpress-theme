 * Much customization can be done here in the style section with a little knowlegde of html and css.
 * As of the creation of this theme front-page.php and tempo.php only use these parallax background images.
 * These backgrounds are available to any page, to change the background images you may either reference 
 * one of the existing classes, change the image references by one of the existing classes, or make your
 * own class. Then you must make sure the html container reference your desired class.
 * Many changes to the skeleton of the website can be made in front-page.php and header.php.
